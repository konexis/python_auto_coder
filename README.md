# python_auto_coder
What if you can live coding at any IDE or record your tutorials or video without have to typing in real time?
This is a simple script that solves this.
It is very simple, ideed.
You just need to import the file that contains your code.
Click on the position you want to begin inserting it, and it is good to go.
It will write 1 line at a time.
If you need to change the speed of the code writing, just change the interval variable.
If you need to change the key that is pressed to write the code (Pause key is Default) just set the key_to_press variable.

Hope you enjoy it.

Best Regards.
