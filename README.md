# python_auto_coder
What if you can live coding at IDE or record your tutorials or video without have to typing in real time?
This is a simple script that solves this.
It is very simple, ideed.
If you need to change the speed of the code writing, just change the interval variable.
If you need to change the key that is pressed to write the code (Pause key is Default) just set the key_to_press variable.

Hope you enjoy it.

Best Regards.
